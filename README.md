In this study we hope to find out how many people who are suffering from long-lasting symptoms after Covid infection (long COVID) are known about by their General Practitioner or by other health professionals.

We will do this by comparing:

electronic health records
reported long Covid in survey data
This will allow us to find out if patients with Long Covid are getting help from their GPs or other health professionals. We can then let GPs know how to work with Long Covid. It could also help to find out which groups of people are likely to be left without help when they have Long Covid
